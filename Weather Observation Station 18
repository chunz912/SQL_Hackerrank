/*
Consider P1(a, b) and P2(c, d) to be two points on a 2D plane.

a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
d happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points  and  and round it to a scale of  decimal places.

Input Format

The STATION table is described as follows:

Field     Type
ID        NUMBER
CITY      VARCHAR2(21)
STATE     VARCHAR2(2)
LAT_N     NUMBER
LONG_W    NUMBER

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

Method 1  CTE version
with min_cte as
(select minLAT = min(LAT_N), minLONG = min(LONG_W) from STATION),
max_cte as
(select maxLAT = max(LAT_N), maxLONG = max(LONG_W) from STATION)

select format(round((maxLAT - minLAT) + (maxLONG - minLONG), 4), '.####')
from min_cte, max_cte

Method 2
select format(round((max(LAT_N) - min(LAT_N)) + (max(LONG_W) - min(LONG_W)), 4), '.####')
from STATION
